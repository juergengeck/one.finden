# FUSED-NFS Implementation

A modern userspace filesystem implementation for macOS using NFSv4 protocol translation.

## Overview

This implementation provides a FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) alternative for macOS that doesn't require kernel extensions. It works by:
1. Implementing a local NFSv4 server
2. Translating FUSE operations to NFS operations
3. Using macOS's built-in NFS client for mounting
