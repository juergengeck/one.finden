the idea of fuse-t - and our package as well, we are a replacement for their 
software - is to not use FUSE, but rather use nfs as the abstraction layer 
towards macos. eventually one will run on desktops and provide file services 
similar to dropbox. 
macfuse cannot be used for that and fuse has become unstable and unusable over
the years. hence this project.
